*UPDATE 1* - This project is still under construction, but it's almost finished! I've added the math_utils module that has everything you need 
in order to get the mutual information of two random variables from a joint frequency table! 

This project is still under construction! However, if you ever want to store a language's vocabulary within a trie, you can do it with the current iteration of the project.
Once the project is fully complete it'll serve as a morphological segmenter that uses the trie data structure to create the morpheme list!
For now though, if you just want to use this as a package, the main code is in the triemorph folder! A lot of the main items are actually scikit-learn estimator and transformer objects, so if your project uses sci-kit learn, then you'll be able to make use of the objects in the project!
